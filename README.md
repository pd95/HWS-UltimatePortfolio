#  Ultimate Portfolio

This project contains my implementation of the learnings of the "Ultimate Portfolio App" series from [Hacking with Swift+](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus/) by Paul Hudson. A really good series of videos and articles about **building a feature rich portfolio app**. I can only recommend it!


I release it here so others can compare their implementation to mine, to help each other in finding bugs.
